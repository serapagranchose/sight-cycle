# duality

Sight Cycle is a 2D game that wavers between the classic platformer and the puzzle-game; created in 48H for the Global Game Jam 2022 on the theme of duality. You control two characters at the same time which reinforces the puzzle side. This game is particularly about the differences between the world around us, which impacts our lives daily during our different life cycles as humans.
